Hi, I'm Manichandra! I recently recieved a degree in Information Systems Technology, where I have developed a solid foundation in both business and technology. I’m passionate about how technology can streamline operations and drive innovation. My coursework has covered a wide range of topics, including database management, systems analysis, and enterprise architecture.

I enjoy working with data-driven systems and exploring how technology can be applied to solve real-world business problems. My experience with tools like SQL, Python, and cloud computing platforms has enhanced my ability to manage and analyze information, providing actionable insights to decision-makers.

I’m excited to bring my skills in systems analysis, database design, and project management into the workplace, and I look forward to contributing to innovative IT solutions.

In my free time, I love exploring new data analysis tools and techniques, and I'm always looking for opportunities to expand my knowledge and skills. Whether working on a team or independently, I am motivated by the thrill of discovering new insights and the satisfaction of using data to solve complex business challenges.
